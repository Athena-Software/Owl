## What is Owl?

Owl is an extension for Chrome and Firefox that allows users to manage their KeePass 2.x database directly in the browser. Currently, it is a read-only implementation; users can sync their database from different providers, and Owl will then show relevant password entries based on the site visited. Given permission, Owl can automagically fill in the username and passwords on websites. In the future, users will be able to add and edit entries directly in the extension.

## Please Note

Both the extension and this documentation website are currently undergoing active development. You can watch the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Athena-Software/Owl/issues) as well as the [author's blog](https://soeren.codes/) for regular updates on Owl. However, we've now released our first version on the Firefox AMO and will release the Chrome version in the near future.
