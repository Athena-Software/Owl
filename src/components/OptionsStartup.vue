			<p>Owl helps you keep track of all your accounts by storing your passwords in an encrypted file called a Keepass 2.x Database. You choose where this file is stored - most people keep them in a cloud storage provider like Dropbox or Google Drive for easy access and syncing between laptops, desktops, and phones. To use Owl, you need to first select one of the storage providers below.</p>

			<a @click="$router.route('/manage/databases')" class="waves-effect waves-light btn">1. Cloud Storage Setup</a>

			<p>Optionally, you may also import any required keyfiles. A keyfile can be used together with a password to provide even better security, or even used instead of one.</p>

			<a @click="$router.route('/manage/keyfiles')" class="waves-effect waves-light btn">2. Keyfile Setup (optional)</a>

			<p>That's it! Owl will automatically discover any KeePass 2.x databases that your have in your cloud storage, and allow you to switch between databases from the browser popup.</p>

			<p>If you are a new KeePass 2.x user, you will be prompted to create a new database from the popup window after you enable a cloud storage provider. Most people keep all their passwords in a single database, so you will only need to do this once.</p>
